Some things I considered adding, but have not the time at the moment...
  - Have a button next to each location, which shows the user the fastest routes
  - Restructure the data to make it easier to manage / extend
  - Items and alternatives i.e. "Anti-dragon shield OR Dragonfire shield" instead of listing both separately
  - Longer lines in the combat tab table have an ellipsis, but should have line wrapping instead
```
